## Description
“Community Science Museum”. Its core target audience is primary and middle school children (ages 7-15) and families with young children. 

- The site should appeal to youngsters without pandering;
- it should take for granted that the audience is curious and           intelligent.
- The website should be informative and engaging, encouraging viewers to visit the museum.
- The website should be responsive and easy to use on various devices.
